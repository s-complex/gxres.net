# About me

Now live in Guangxi, China. I am studying Information Security Technology at a university in there.

Made a few contributions to [LittleSkin](https://littleskin.cn), [14Cloud](https://speed.14cloud.cn), [Nitro](https://nitro.build), [obuild](https://github.com/unjs/obuild) and [Nuxt Shiki](https://github.com/pi0/nuxt-shiki).

Building new things with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Vue](https://vuejs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Nitro](https://nitro.build). I am considering learning Rust or Go in the future.

I love rhythm games, Minecraft, foods and photography.
